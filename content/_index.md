  Build your next IoT product with proven technology
aboutNerves: |
  <strong>Nerves</strong> is the open-source platform and infrastructure you
  need to build, deploy, and securely manage your fleet of IoT devices at speed
  and scale.

introduction:
  Hardware doesn't have to be hard. Nerves makes edge computing easier by solving
  the most complex infrastructure problems. Let Nerves take care of the network,
  discovery, I/O, firmware updates, and more. Focus your team on what matters —
  writing robust and maintainable software.
features:
  - name: 'Scalable'

    description: |
      Nerves is written in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org), but
      you don't have to rewrite everything in Elixir to get the advantages of
      Nerves — simply bring your own code (like C, C++, Python, Rust, and more)
      and scale up.
  - name: 'High Reliability'

      Nerves uses the
      [Erlang runtime system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)),
      known for being distributed, fault-tolerant, soft real-time, and highly
      available.
  - name: 'Agile'

    description: |
      Nerves helps you bring the principles of agile development to your IoT
      development cycle. Because Nerves runtime is immutable, Nerves also
      brings agility to long-term maintenance.
technologiesIntroduction: |
  Nerves defines a new way to build embedded systems, using Erlang virtual machine, Elixir and Linux.

      - Simple strategy for building reliable programs
      that's consistent through the whole language and ecosystem
        - There's really only one way to build things and it involves message
        passing to fine-grained lightweight processes that are monitored and
        recovered via supervision trees
        - No other language or ecosystem has such
      consistency here and it gives confidence that the blast radius from
      failures is contained
      - Virtual machine with fine-grained Garbage collection (GC)
        - You get the benefits of a higher level language without the GC cost

      - Built on top of the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM)
      - Fun language - the second most loved programming language in
      [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)

      - Allows Nerves to run on lots of hardware
      - Enables use of code that's not yet available for the
      [Erlang virtual machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine))
